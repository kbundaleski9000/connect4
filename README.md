# Description

This project focuses on implementing an agent in Python to address challenges 
akin to those encountered in Connect Four strategy optimization. The primary aim is to devise
an efficient approach for determining optimal moves within a Connect Four game, taking into 
account game state, potential winning strategies, and opponent tactics.

# Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the project
depends on, and they will be installed using:

If you do specify strict versions, it is important to do so for *all*
your dependencies, not just direct dependencies.
Strictly specifying only some dependencies is a recipe for environments
breaking over time.

# Execution & Output

- Install Dependencies: Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed. You can install them using pip by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
